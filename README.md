# MNIST_Data

The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.

Although the dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop using different activation functions, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification from scratch. This includes how to develop a robust test harness for estimating the performance of the model, how to exploredifferent activation functions to the model.
